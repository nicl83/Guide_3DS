### Lectură obligatorie

There have been multiple improvements and advancements to methods for installing CFW over the last short while.

For this reason, it is recommended that you follow [Installing boot9strap (USM)](installing-boot9strap-(usm)) whenever possible.

However, "legacy" or outdated methods are kept here for various purposes. They will require that you have done [Seedminer](seedminer) first.

If you need help, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for assistance.

#### Secțiunea I - Teste de compatibilitate

The following exploits make use of one of two DS-mode applications built into the 3DS: DS Internet Settings and DS Download Play.

If both DS Internet Settings and DS Download Play fail to work, you will have to repair them with [TWLFix-3DS](https://github.com/MechanicalDragon0687/TWLFix-3DS/releases/) using a homebrew entrypoint, such as PicHaxx.
