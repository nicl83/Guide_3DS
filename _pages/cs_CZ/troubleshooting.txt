### Required Reading

If you are unable to boot your device, please look for the section relevant to you and follow the instructions.

If you still cannot solve your issue and need to reach out for help, please paste the contents of all relevant .log files from the root of your SD card into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), then come for help prepared with a detailed description of your problem and what you've tried.

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions. 

To use the [magnet](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme) links on this page, you will need a torrent client like [Deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).

## Cannot inject H&S on Gateway downgraded device

This is caused by Gateway implementing a very shoddy downgrade method which leaves two versions of each app on the system. One of them is unused, but it confuses the H&S inject system, causing it to inject into the wrong one.

1. Power off your device
1. Press and hold (Start), and while holding (Start), power on your device. This will launch GodMode9
1. Navigate to `[1:] SYSNAND CTRNAND` -> `title` -> `00040010`

  + **Old 3DS or Old 2DS USA**: `00021300` -> `content`
  + **New 3DS or New 2DS EUR**: `20022300` -> `content`
  + **New 3DS or New 2DS JPN**: `20020300` -> `content`
  + **New 3DS or New 2DS USA**: `20021300` -> `content`
1. Notice that there are two sets of app and tmd files, one set with uppercase extensions (`.TMD` and `.APP`), and one set with lowercase extensions (`.tmd` and `.app`)
1. While holding the (R) trigger, press (Y) to create a new directory
1. Press (A) to confirm the name `newdir` (it does not matter what the folder is called)
1. Press (A) to unlock SysNAND (lvl1) writing, then input the key combo given
1. Press (B) to decline relocking write permissions if prompted
1. Press the (L) trigger on each of the uppercase extension files (`.TMD` and `.APP`) to mark them
1. Press (Y) to copy the files
1. Navigate to `newdir`
1. Press (Y) to paste the files
1. Select "Move path(s)"
1. The uppercase extension files will have been moved to the `newdir` directory
1. Press (Start) to reboot your device
1. Retry the H&S injection
1. If this still doesn't work, move the uppercase extension files back to the `content` folder, then move the lowercase extension files to the `newdir` folder, then retry the H&S injection
