title: "Uninstall CFW"
---

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

This will completely remove CFW from your device, including boot9strap and Luma3DS, for the purpose of restoring the device to stock.

This is never the solution to fix any issues you may be encountering with your CFW installation. A better idea would be to ask (in English) for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).
{: .notice--danger}

Any unsigned (illegitimate) games will be rendered unusable and should be manually removed before starting this process by using the Data Management section of the System Settings. Use a [save manager](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest) to backup any saves for these unsigned (illegitimate) games you care about.

If you have modified critical system software (such as editing the home menu, unbanning your console, etc), uninstalling CFW WILL BRICK your device! Ensure that you follow all sections of this page.
{: .notice--danger}

Note that if you have any payload files other than `GodMode9.firm` in the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a "chainloader menu" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select "GodMode9" for these instructions. 

### What You Need

* The latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest)
